# Tiny13Watchdog
This repo includes the escentials to run a blink example on the attiny13 but using the watchdog timer to put and get the MCU from deep sleep for power consumption saving

This code is a result of a great project i've seen here: https://www.instructables.com/id/Love-Spark-1/ and thought would be a great one to use the benefits of low power consumtion of the MCU's sleep modes.
